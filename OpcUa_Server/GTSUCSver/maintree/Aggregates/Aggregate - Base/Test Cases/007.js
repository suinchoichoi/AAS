    In the initialize.js of each Conformance Unit the AggregateHelper object
    is being initialized with a different parameter identifying the 
    Conformance Unit which is currently tested. 
    The cleanup script ( maintree/Aggregates/Aggregate - Base/cleanup.js )
    is being reused as well.

For each supported aggregate, select a startTime, endTime, and a processingInterval
from within the recorded range for a single node except there are multiple values within the range.
