    This script is being reused by other Aggregation conformance units. 
    In the initialize.js of each Conformance Unit the AggregateHelper object
    is being initialized with a different parameter identifying the 
    Conformance Unit which is currently tested. 
    The cleanup script ( maintree/Aggregates/Aggregate - Base/cleanup.js )
    is being reused as well.

For each supported aggregate, select startTime, endTime, processingInterval from within the recorded range 
for a single node where (note, some variations may not apply to the particular aggregate):								
-           startTime such that a starting bound is not found								
-           processingInterval = any								
-           userServerCapabilitiesDefauts = TRUE
