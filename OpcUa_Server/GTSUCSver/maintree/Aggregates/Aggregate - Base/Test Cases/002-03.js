    In the initialize.js of each Conformance Unit the AggregateHelper object
    is being initialized with a different parameter identifying the 
    Conformance Unit which is currently tested. 
    The cleanup script ( maintree/Aggregates/Aggregate - Base/cleanup.js )
    is being reused as well.

    For each supported aggregate, select startTime, endTime, processingInterval 
    from within the recorded range for  multiple nodes/aggregates where: 								
        startTime < endTime								
        processingInterval Greater than or equal to range
