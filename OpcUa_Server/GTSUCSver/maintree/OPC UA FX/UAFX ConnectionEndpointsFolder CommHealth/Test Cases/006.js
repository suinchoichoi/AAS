    Description: Verify that the CommPreOperational bit of the CommHealth variable is set
                 if a PubSubConnectionEndpoint with Mode Subscriber or  PublisherSubscriber
                 is waiting on the security keys of a Publisher. 
         Step 1: Configure the AC as Subscriber and the CTT as Publisher.
