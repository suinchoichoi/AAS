/*  Test prepared by Ingenieurbuero Allmendinger: info@allmendinger.de
    Description: Verify that the CommPreOperational bit of the CommHealth variable is set
                 if a PubSubConnectionEndpoint with Mode PublisherSubscriber is waiting
                 on the Heartbeat of a Subscriber. 
         Step 1: Configure the AC as Publisher and the CTT as Subscriber. 
         Step 2: Configure an unidirectional connection with heartbeat between AutomationComponent
                 and CTT. 
         Step 3: Establish the connection but don't provide the Heartbeat.
         Step 4: Read the value of the CommHealth Variable.
