    Description: Check VerifyAsset behavior when the VerificationMode is AssetCompatibility and
                 values of  verification variables MISMATCH.
         Step 1: Browse any Asset in the Assets Folder.
         Step 2: Set VerificationMode to AssetCompatibility.
         Step 3: Read all supported verification variables for VerificationMode AssetCompatibility.
                 Select any  verification variable (only one) and modify the value according to
                 the vendors documentation such that the expected verification result is a Mismatch.
                 Use the modified variable value to construct the input argument for the method call
                 in Step 4.
         Step 4: Call VerifyAsset and provide the modified Values and BrowseNames from previous steps
                 as ExpectedVerificationVariables and VerificationMode.
         Step 5: Repeat previous steps for any supported verification variable of the selected
                 top level Asset.
         Step 6: Repeat previous steps for every top level Asset with documented compatible settings.
