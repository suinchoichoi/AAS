        Test is shared between [ConditionRefresh][ConditionRefresh2]

    Description:    
        Verify the structure of a RefreshStopEventType event.

    Requirements: 
        This test will use a cached version of an event that should have been previously received.
    
    Expectation:
        The event should match

    How this test works:
        If there is no saved event, then this should trigger refresh to get a start/end event
