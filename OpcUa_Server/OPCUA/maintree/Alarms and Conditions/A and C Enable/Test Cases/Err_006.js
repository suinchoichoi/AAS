/*
    Test prepared by Archie Miller; archie.miller@opcfoundation.org

    Description: 
        Enable a condition instance that the user does not have access to.
    
    Requirements:
        Condition has access-rights preventing the user access.        
    
    Expectation:
        Server rejects request. If user access rights are not supported this test is skipped - BadUserAccessDenied

    How this test works:
        Manual Test
