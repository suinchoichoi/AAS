/*  Test 5.10.1 Test 28, prepared by Nathan Pocock; compliance@opcfoundation.org
    Description:    	Create a subscription (no monitoredItems) with a RequestedPublishingInterval of 1000 and a RequestedMaxKeepAliveCount of 5.
                        Wait (RevisedPublishingInterval + 500) milliseconds and then call Publish().
                        Wait ((RevisedPublishingInterval * RevisedMaxKeepAliveCount) + 500) milliseconds and then call Publish() again.
    ExpectedResult:     All service and operation results are Good.
                        Both Publish calls immediately return a keep-alive notificationMessage.
